        <h3>A Simple Cheesecake Recipe</h3>
        <p>If you've ever wanted to make a cheesecake look no further!</p>
        <p>A simple recipe to follow for beginners. Perfect desert for a dinner party!</p>
        
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>32 oz cream cheese softened to room temperature</li>
            <li>1 cup sugar</li>
            <li>2/3 cups sour cream</li>
            <li>1.5 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1/8 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>4 large eggs room temperature, lightly beaten</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 325F.</li>
            <li>In the bowl of a stand mixer or in a large bowl (using a hand mixer) add cream cheese and stir until smooth and creamy (don't over-beat or you'll incorporate too much air).</li>
            <li>Add sugar and stir again until creamy.</li>
            <li>Add sour cream, vanilla extract, and salt, and stir until well-combined. If using a stand mixer, make sure you pause periodically to scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl with a spatula so that all ingredients are evenly incorporated.</li>
            <li>With mixer on low speed, gradually add lightly beaten eggs, one at a time, stirring just until each egg is just incorporated. Once all eggs have been added, use a spatula to scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl again and make sure all ingredients are well combined.</li>
            <li>Pour cheesecake batter into graham cracker crust. To insure against leaks, place the pan on a cookie sheet that's been lined with foil.</li>
            <li>Transfer to the center rack of your oven and bake on 325F for 50-60 minutes (or longer as needed, see note 3). Edges will likely have slightly puffed and may have just begun to turn a light golden brown and the center should spring back to the touch but will still be Jello-jiggly. Don't over-bake or the texture will suffer, which means we all suffer.</li>
            <li>Remove from oven and allow to cool on top of the oven⁴ for 10 minutes. Once 10 minutes has passed, use a knife to gently loosen the crust from the inside of the pan (this will help prevent cracks as your cheesecake cools and shrinks).</li>
            <li>Allow cheesecake to cool another 1-2 hours or until near room temperature before transferring to refrigerator and allowing to cool overnight or at least 6 hours.</li>
        </ol>
            <h4>Notes</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Exact bake time can vary depending on your oven. I recommend checking your cheesecake at 50 minutes and adding time as needed. However, it is not uncommon for the cheesecake to take as long as 75 minutes to bake, but it's better to check sooner. </li>
            <li>Remember, a cheesecake is a custard, not a cake. To avoid any cracks, make sure to take it out when it's a firm jello-like consistency.</li>
            <li>I recommend the top of the oven because it is usually the warmest place in my house (after it’s been on for over an hour). This will help to cool the cheesecake more gradually and will also help avoid cracks). </li>
        </ul>
